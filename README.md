# AIRway

FUTURE WORK

## Build instructions

Check out [AIRroot](https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRroot) for framework build instructions.

## Why the name?

AIRways are aviation flight corridors.

Changes to AIRport Repositories need to be delivered between AIRport instances in a timely and efficient manner.

## Description

Decentralized and P2P file system adaptors for AIRport.

Currently AIRway hosts code necessary to test cross-AIRport communication.  It also has some prototypes for
possible future usecases.

AIRway is the place where the code for browser-to-browser and AIRport Native App to Native App/browser code
should live.
