## Why the name?

AIRways are aviation flight corridors.

Changes to AIRport Repositories need to be delivered between AIRport instances in a timely and efficient manner.

possible future usecases.

AIRway is the place where the code for browser-to-browser and AIRport Native App to Native App/browser code
